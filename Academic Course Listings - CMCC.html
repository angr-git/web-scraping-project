<br>6 Hrs/Wk ( 6 Hr. Lecture, 0 Hrs. Shop) *7.5 wks
<br>This course will demonstrate the effect improper building practices have on the structural integrity of a home and teach students to recognize structural load path transfer from roof to footing.  Building course outcomes around these two focal points will give students the knowledge and understanding to make critical construction decisions allowing them to apply best building practices.  We are an unlicensed trade in the State of Maine.  While many building practices are obviously correct or obviously deficient, this course will illustrate the differences and consequences of improper building practices.  Students will immediately apply this knowledge in their remaining field experiences.  Prerequisite: Enrolled in Jobsite Track program or Dept. Chair Approval.

<br>This is the student’s first course in electricity. Atomic structure and units of electrical charge are covered as they apply to D.C. circuits. Test equipment includes voltmeters, ammeters, ohmmeters, power supplies and oscilloscopes. Problem solving techniques will be developed using a basic model of problem analysis. Particular emphasis is placed on Ohm's Law, Kirchoff's voltage and current laws, series, parallel, series-parallel circuits, magnetism, and basic DC ammeter and voltmeter design. The student will learn advanced techniques such as Superposition, Norton, Thevenin, and Millman's theorems used in trouble-shooting complex circuits and networks. The course will provide a foundation for future studies in the electrical and electronics areas.

<br>This course is a study of the functioning of electrical devices that are primarily used for manual switching of circuits such as piloted single-pole switches, Eagle three-way switches, four-way switches, momentary relays, and latching relays.  Emphasis is placed on methods of wiring these devices into a system following NEC procedures and interpreting blueprints and schematics. Applications include wiring switches to control lights and receptacles. Complete switching systems are formed by wiring together electrical equipment such as time-clocks, photoeyes, and relays. Single-phase transformers are used to step-up, step-down, and buck/boost voltages. DC motors are tested and connected for specific direction of rotation and speed.

<br>This course provides a foundation in critical thinking, problem solving, and mathematical applications aligned with citizenship, workforce and real-world applications. The goal of the course is to engage students in meaningful mathematical experiences that will increase the student’s quantitative reasoning and problem-solving abilities and strengthen the mathematical abilities that they will encounter in other disciplines. A focus of the course is to develop and support communication and collaboration skills through project-based learning. The course topics include solving linear equations, formulas, radicals, the U.S. and international units of measurement, descriptive statistics and interpreting graphs, geometry of some common geometric shapes and the Pythagorean Theorem. Also included will be right triangle trigonometry, trigonometry of any angle.

<br>Are religious beliefs vastly different from one another? Are they a major cause of strife around the world or a source of peace? Where are the similarities? Can religions even exist in our hectic 21st Century world? Can science and religion coexist? Does God even exist? Comparative religions will look for answers by examining the major religious traditions of the world. From the West – Christianity, Judaism, Islam. From the East – Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism. In addition, we’ll explore some of the lesser known beliefs such as Native American beliefs, Paganism, Wicca, Scientology, and others. We’ll be following a text, but the course will also include several primary sources and religious documents for a more comprehensive understanding.

<br>3 Credits (3 Lecture 0 Lab 0 Shop)
<br>3 Hr/Wk (3 Hr. Lecture) *15 weeks
<br>This is an active hands-on course that introduces students to the basics of stage acting including voice production, physical expression, stage conventions, character development and text interpretation. Group exercises will be interspersed with discussion, viewing and responding to student performances, the occasional brief lecture and video. The class will attend and write about one professional show* (required). Students will present rehearsed, fully memorized, in-class performances of one monologue and two scenes. While there will be class time dedicated to rehearsals, at least half of the rehearsals for the in-class performances must take place outside of class meeting time. Assigned reading will include chapters from the required text, one play and miscellaneous brief articles. Written work will include weekly e-journal entries, monologue and scene script scores, a written response to a professional production and a final scene project portfolio.  We will attend a professional theater production.  Ticket price and transportation are the responsibility of the student.
